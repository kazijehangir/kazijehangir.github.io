Disclaimer: This post is a true rambling post within my ramblings. It is purely for me to reflect on later personally and not intended for anyone to read except for future me as a reminder and a journal log. Please feel free to skip to the next (if existing) post.

I do not know what I am doing here. The people around me all have their shit together. How will I ever make it there.

Unless you have never pushed yourself out of your comfort zone, you will have felt some or all of these emotions at some point. That is expected. 

See me struggling to learn a reasonably regular language, while I hear about people not too far away speaking 15+ languages fluently. See me struggling to put basic engineering concepts in words and taking noticeable breaks to understand designes explained to me, while the person explaining seems to have no issue preempting the design considerations and the questions about their solution, even before I have finished parsing what they said. See me struggling to maintain a healthy balance between being an expat glad to have oppurtunities in a developed country, and yearning for the home I feel displaced from. 

Living the life of dreams and yet stuck in a personal nightmare.

Understand, and truly know, their language and you will know the people. 

Humanity disappoints, people inspire. 

Do you believe you have unlimited potential? Do you think that belief motivates you, or does it make you beat yourself down? The drive to improve, the unsatisfaction, is at the most core of being human. It is what brought us out of the caves. Do not fight it. But do not let it be the only drive in your life. 

Rational thought is good. Rationalizing everything is not. Do some things purely for the joy of doing it. Not everything has to be a logical decision. 
Disclaimer for the above: Obviously do not make decisions that trade momentary joy for long term issues. The decisions in question are the ones which are largely inconsequential in the larger scheme of things; but people, like me, obsess over.

I have been taking Japanese lessons for more than 5 months now. I am still not even at basic conversion level. I know what the problem or the issue blocking me is. I do not practice in my own time; I do not even revise what I learn in the lessons later on. I do not know how I have been justifying this to myself; but it has evidently been working as I am not changing much. If I try to understand my lack of motivation in learning Japanese I find that it is not just Japanese but I am not motivated to do much beyond the bare minimum to get by.

I have realized that I spent roughly 40-45 hours at work; add another 10 hours each week for getting ready and getting to work, and 50 hours per week for sleep, and I still have 168 - (45+10+50) = 63 hours per week for myself. That is roughly 1.5 times the work time. I should theoretically be able to do as atleast as much productive work as a full time job, but in practice theory is rarely the same as theory, and I don't.   

Such has been the story for the past 6 months. I have explained away everything with the "moving and settling into a new country" trope. I do not thing that can be valid anymore. 

I would like to believe this is all getting better. I have been focussing on being more active in my career and my regular work. I am also tracking my time and trying to be more personally accountable for it. I have made a couple of attempts to have certain tasks and side projects which give me a reason to learn a skill and improve on it. I have also started enjoying Tokyo as a great place to live in, by trying new cuisines and restuarants and generally being more willing to try new things. 

This all should, in theory, help.
