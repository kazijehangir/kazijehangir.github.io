I have been meaning to write this for a long long time. I never got around to it because of lack of motivation though. Last week I was asked to speak at a session at LUMS on applying to grad schools and other university advice. It was after I had repeated what I had done to get to this point multiple times that I realized that it would be vastly more helpful to people if I actually wrote this down. 

Treat this as a rambling story of my last two years at LUMS and what I wish I had done differently or treat it as whatever I have learnt and wish more people knew. Following this is entirely up to you.

A rough timeline of events
*.  Fall 2015 - Sophomore year.
I was advised to take Intro to AI a year earlier as it was considered an easy course and it would lessen the load fom my Junior year Fall semester. In a few words, it went terribly. I was in way above my head and it made me question if I could really program or not.

*.  Spring 2016 - Sophomore year.
I took CS300 (Advanced Programming), even after the troubles with AI the previous semester. As it turned out, AP was to be one of the best courses I took in LUMS. I learnt more during this course than any other, and I have never been more focussed during any other class. Not sure which one was the cause and which one was the result.
It was during this semester that I approached Dr. Junaid Haroon Siddiqui for some general course advice and to ask if he had work for me during the summer.
