I have been meaning to write this for a long long time. I never got around to it because of lack of motivation though. Last week I was asked to speak at a session at LUMS on applying to grad schools and other university advice. It was after I had repeated what I had done to get to this point multiple times that I realized that it would be vastly more helpful to people if I actually wrote this down. 

Treat this as a rambling story of my last two years at LUMS and what I wish I had done differently or treat it as whatever I have learnt and wish more people knew. Following my advice is entirely up to you.
