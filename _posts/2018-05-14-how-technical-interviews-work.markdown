There is a lot of information out there regarding technical interviews and these guides are much better at advice than I can ever give. The main one I can recommend is "Cracking the Coding Interview"; it is an invaluable resource while preparing for these interviews.

That said, I wanted to give a quick rundown of what I know about the interview process based on personal experience.

<h2> The overall process </h2>

- Automated resume screening
 
 Most people will apply online to these companies and submit their resume for an automatic review process. People suggest that using a difficult to understand format (for a machine) for your resume is a bad idea. There is probably some keyword matching and some ML thrown in there. Regardless, I dont think there is much you can do to optimize your resume for this step. Make a good resume (for a human reviewer) and that should be good enough for the algorithm as well.

 If you can get a referral into the company, you can skip this step altogether. Take a look at my post about [how referrals work]({% post_url 2018-05-13-how-referrals-work %}) for a detailed explaination.

- Recruiter resume screening 

 Similar to the above, having an objectively good resume is the way to go here. Look up some guides on good resume practices. Take a look at eye movement heat maps for recruiters, it really puts things into perspective.

- Online test/quiz
 
 This is usually just a very preliminary weeding out process. Take a look at Google Code Jam questions for some examples and a basic idea of the difficulty level. You typically get 2 questions and 2+ hours to solve them. I beleive most people with reasonable programming skills should be able to solve these questions. If you cannot solve these in 2 hours without the pressure of an actual interview, you really need to brush up your programming/problem solving skills.

- Technical interviews (2 for internship, 4/5 for full time) 
 
 This is the most important step of the entire process, and the one most people fail at. 

- Team matching 

- Offer
